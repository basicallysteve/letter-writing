      <p>On the short horizon, a system is being set up for congregations to maintain their own information. This will allow multiple congregations to exist together within the environment</p>

      <p class="subtitle">Assignment Scheduling</p>
      <p>In the future, I would like to create a way to manage the assignments of the friends. Messages would be sent the brother or sister that has an assignment 
         and they would get reminders and a call to application via email/SMS when their assignment is coming up.</p>
